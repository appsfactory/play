Overview
--------

This project is for the Apps Factory team to use for experimentation and learning how to work with
git. Feel free to make any changes to any of the files in this
repository.

Process
-------

Once you have your github account set up, follow rmdrimmie and pester me
in some fashion to have you added to the repo (*note*: I will only do this for
Apps Factory team members). 

Clone the repository and make a file named for yourself (eg rob.txt).

Add, commit and push the file to the repo.

Afterwards, feel free to edit files and try to experience a conflict.
